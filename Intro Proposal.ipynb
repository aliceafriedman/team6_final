    "What makes a social media post popular? What elements cause a Tweet to be liked or shared via retweet? Using a corpus of tweets from users loosely connected to a political candidate, we  aimed to find out. Team 6 worked with a corpus of 100,000+ tweets scraped from the followers of presidential-hopeful Mike Gravel (@mikegravel) on two dates, roughly one-month apart. The corpus was used to:\n",

    "For the Final Project, we are sticking our initial approach of pulling data via the Twitter API from followers of Mike Gravel that we identified in that first project. However, we’ve updated our code to pull the text of the tweets and metadata such as number of retweets and likes. As of the time of the proposal, we appear to be limited to only pulling the last tweet from a given user at the time of our accessing the API, which is a significant limitation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We’re aware that our sample of tweets is specific to people following a fringe primary candidate and not representative of social media overall or even just “political Twitter” itself. Still, an older political candidate curious about the sentiments and topics prevalent among younger, politically engaged users on social media could find an expanded version of our exercise useful in defining a strategy for voter engagement.  \n",
